          Soooooo this used to be filler, but i'll actually tell you about myself. I love playing
          soccer, i'm about to be 17, and I started learning how to code earlier this year. ermm
          that's about it really, ngl. At least the most i'm comfortable sharing 😣. This website
          is a project made as part of a bootcamp. Feels good to have a live working website, even if
          in a month it won't exist anymore... But yeah. 😁👍
